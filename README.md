This is my coding file for Mulesoft internship program at NLC labs.
In this code I have created a database 'usersdb' and a table 'movie' in it. The table 'movie' contains three entries of movie details inserted by me. I learned to create a database in SQLite for this internship coding test,connect my SQLite database with java code and retrieving the records of table using java code and also learned to upload my code file from eclipse to github.
