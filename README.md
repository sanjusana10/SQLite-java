This is my coding file for Mulesoft internship program at NLC labs.
In this code I have created a database 'usersdb' and a table 'movie' in it. The table 'movie' contains three entries of movie details insrted by me. I learned to create a database in SQLite for this internship and also I learned to connect my SQLite database with java code and retrieving the records of table using java code.
